📖 Story Context
Ashok Vatika Chaos is inspired by events from the Ramayan, focusing on Hanuman’s destruction of Ashok Vatika and his battles against Ravana’s generals.
The final level portrays Meghnath’s Brahmastra capture sequence — handled respectfully and narratively rather than as a typical “game over”.
